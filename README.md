# ESP8266-TempNodeJS
This takes temperature readings from a DHT11 sensor attached to an ESP8266 microcontroller. I use Arduino IDE to flash the ESP-12E module. Node js, Express and MongoDB handle the backend and database. WebSockets are used to emit data from the ESP device to the web server. Further, another web socket is being used to emit temperature objects to the front-end.
